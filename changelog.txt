1.3.2
1.  Added light mode.
2.  Restyled a little bit.
3.  Removed version names from files and intructions, 
    because it's annoying to update everything every update.


1.3.1
1.  Restyled everything, because the contrast was too random 
    and some things were hard to read.

    -   Known: Middle Mouse Button

    -   Add to Anki: Q
