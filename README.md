# japReader
### An Electron app that helps you read Japanese text. 

------------------

###### Version 1.2 created by [seth-js](https://github.com/seth-js)
###### Versions 1.3+ (this repo) forked and maintained by [marisukukise](https://github.com/marisukukise)

------------------

## Examples
![Example screenshot #1](images/examples/example1.png)  
![Example screenshot #2](images/examples/example2.png)

------------------

## Currently Supported
VNs, LNs, TV Shows/Movies


## Features
* Parser and dictionary from [ichi.moe](https://ichi.moe/cl/qr/?q=&r=kana)
* Word status tracking
* DeepL translations (no bullshit limits)
* One-click Anki sentence/word card creation
* Furigana support


## How does this work?
* It watches your clipboard for Japanese text. Once Japanese text is detected, it gets parsing and dictionary data from [ichi.moe](https://ichi.moe/cl/qr/?q=&r=kana).
* The word status tracking is done by checking each parsed dictionary form of a word against a small collection of word databases that accumulate as you use the program.
* The Anki feature uses the [AnkiConnect](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect) API to send over the necessary card data.

------------------

# Installation
## Windows
1. Go to [latest release](https://github.com/marisukukise/japReader/releases/latest)
2. Download a file like `japreader-x.y.z.Setup.exe`
3. Run it. The .exe is not signed, so there might be some warnings. 

Alternatively, if you don't want to install, you can download the .zip package:
1. Go to [latest release](https://github.com/marisukukise/japReader/releases/latest)
2. Download a file like `japreader-win32-x64-x.y.z.zip`
3. Extract it and run with `japreader.exe`


## Linux
1. Go to [latest release](https://github.com/marisukukise/japReader/releases/latest)
2. Download a file matching your distribution
3. Install the file using your package manager and sudo version
If there is no package available for your distribution, you may try 
downloading the `japreader-linux-x64-x.y.z.zip` file and running `./japreader`,
however it's less reliable (it didn't work for me on Fedora Linux, but .rpm package does)
If none of the above works, you can try [Building](#Build) the program yourself.
> **_NOTE:_** It may happen that your clipboard reading will not work on Linux
> I did fix it and it works for me fresh out of install right now, but maybe it will be different
> on other distributions. If this is the case, you should go to the install directory of japreader
> (you can check the location using `whereis japreader`), and then run the command
> `sudo chmod 777 node_modules/clipboard-event/platform/clipboard-event-handler-linux`
> in the app's directory. It is a C program reading clipboard, and it needs execution permissions. 
> This should be automatically set, but maybe for some reason it isn't.
> Then you will be able to run a program that monitors change in your clipboard.
> If you did this and it still doesn't work, please open an issue.

# Build
1. Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/marisukukise/japReader.git`
3. Navigate into it `cd japReader`
4. Install dependencies `npm i`
5. If you're on Linux, run `sudo chmod 777 node_modules/clipboard-event/platform/clipboard-event-handler-linux`, 
   if you're on Windows ignore this point
6. Build files `npm run make`
7. The files will be output in `out/make/<your_platform>/x64` folder

If you want to run this without installing, in point 6. of [Build](#Build) you can instead run the program using `npm start`

## FAQ
Q: Why does the text \"i+1\" keep showing?  
A: When the the text \"i+1\" shows up, that means there is only one unknown word in the sentence. This is perfect for sentence/vocab Anki cards.

Q: Why does the translation text dim sometimes?  
A: This happens when there is only one unknown word in the sentence. You should hopefully be able to not depend on the translation.

Q: I don\'t like a feature, is there any way I can turn it off?  
A: Press `O` while one of the windows is in focus. The options menu will open up. All settings can be modified from there.
